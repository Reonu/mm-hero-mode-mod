# Hero Mode for Majora's Mask Recompiled
![Mod Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3fca95f-791f-4f14-9624-fb933aff60de)

By default, this mod sets the damage multiplier to 2x and disables recovery heart drops, just like the Hero Mode in other Zelda games.

However, you can also set a custom damage multiplier or keep the recovery hearts if you wish by entering the mod's config menu. You can also prevent recovery fairies from spawning. There's even a 1 hit KO option, and an option to lose all rupees upon dying!
