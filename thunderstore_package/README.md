# Hero Mode for Majora's Mask Recompiled


By default, this mod sets the damage multiplier to 2x and disables recovery heart drops, just like the Hero Mode in other Zelda games.
However, you can also set a custom damage multiplier or keep the recovery hearts if you wish by entering the mod's config menu. There's even a 1 hit KO option!
